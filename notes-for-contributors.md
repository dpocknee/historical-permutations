# Notes for contributors

Remember to use npm commands:

- `npm version patch`: version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- `npm version minor`: version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- `npm version major`: version when you make incompatible API changes

to update the version automatically rather than manually updating them. These commands are based on Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
